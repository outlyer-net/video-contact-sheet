# vcs:conf: $Rev$
# Example vcs.conf file
# This example files contains all the default values, commented out.
# For each setting, where an equivalent command-line option exists it will be
# listed in the comments
#
# Location:
#   Configuration files can be placed at /etc/vcs.conf (site-wide),
#   ~/.vcs.conf (current user, hidden file!), ./vcs.conf (current dir) or
#   ~/.vcs/vcs.conf (current user, new alternative location)
#
# Syntax:
#   * Comments start with '#' or ';'
#   * '#' can be used in values by writing $#
#   * Semicolons (;) can't be used in values
#   * Options are of the form name=value
#     - Options can refer to the *current* value of other options, i.e.
#       font_sign=$font_heading will assign to 'font_sign' the same value
#       as 'font_heading'. If font_heading is changed after that, font_sign
#       won't be affected.
#     - See <http://p.outlyer.net/dox/vcs:conf_files> for the full list

# Height of individual captures. Percentage or fixed size (in pixels)
height=100% # option -H

# Amount ignored from the end of the video (think of it as an anti-spoiler
# measure). Percentage (of video duration) or time (e.g. 2m). Set to 0
# to disable it.

captures=16

# Mode of operation, can be either $TC_NUMCAPS or $TC_INTERVAL (the default)

# $TC_INTERVAL  Fix interval, adjust the number of captures accordingly

# Modifier for extended mode (option -e).
# Beware, setting it to something different from 0 automatically enables extended mode!

# Colours and fonts #
#####################

# * Colours can be defined either by their name or through hexcodes
#   use the command 'identify -list color' for a list of known names
# * Colours can use transparency, although this usually only makes sense
#   for timestamps, which are overlaid on captures.
# * Beware when specifying colours in hex format color=#hex is ok
#   but color = #hex not, spaces can be used with color = $#hex
# * Font sizes are expressed in points and hence might need adjustment
#   when the font is changed.
# * Font names can be either font paths (e.g. /usr/something/ttf/font.ttf)
#   or font names as understood by ImageMagick, use the command
#   'identify -list font' for a list of fonts known to ImageMagick
